# Contributing to Historical Hurricane Data Analysis

Thank you for your interest in this humanitarian research project. This repository contains analyzed historical hurricane data intended to support disaster preparedness, human rights documentation, and research efforts worldwide.

## Project Purpose

This is a public humanitarian dataset documenting historical hurricane patterns and impacts. The goal is to make this data freely available for research, education, disaster preparedness, and human rights advocacy purposes.

## Core Data Integrity

**Important:** The core historical hurricane data files in this repository are maintained as authoritative records and should not be modified. These files include:
- Historical_Hurricane_Report_Atlantic.ipynb
- cleaned_atlantic_hurricane_data.csv
- cleaned_pacific_hurricane_data.csv
- hurdata_cleaner.ipynb
- key_to_columns.pdf

These files represent verified historical records and analysis. Maintaining their integrity is essential for the reliability of research and advocacy work that depends on this data.
